Storage for simple personal projects with Bash Scripts, C, Python and SQL.

Bash Scripts:
1. ðŸ—‚ random_file_folder_generator:
   This program takes the current system date and time as seperate variables and creates an empty file or folder named with it; in the format "hours:minutes:seconds.year-month-day".
   NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
