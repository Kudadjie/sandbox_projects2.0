Storage for simple personal projects with Bash Scripts, C, Python and SQL.
*****************************

Bash Scripts:
1. 🗂 random_file_folder_generator:
   This program takes the current system date and time as seperate variables and creates an empty file or folder named with it; in the format "hours:minutes:seconds.year-month-day".
   NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
   
2.  👨‍🔧 interactive_no_return_nav_menu:
      This program provides a very 'very' limited skeleton GUI, which can be used to navigate certain places on a linux device. The program should be sourced (user@computer $ source ./interactive_no_return_nav_menu.sh). Program is open to modifications to increase functionability.
      NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
