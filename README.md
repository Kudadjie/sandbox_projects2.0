Storage for simple personal projects with Bash Scripts, C, Python and SQL.
*****************************

Bash Scripts:
1. 🗂 [random_file_folder_generator](https://github.com/Kudadjie/sandbox_projects2.0/blob/master/bash_scripts/random_file_folder_generator.sh):
   This program takes the current system date and time as seperate variables and creates an empty file or folder named with it; in the format "hours:minutes:seconds.year-month-day".
   NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
   
2.  👨‍🔧 [interactive_no_return_nav_menu](https://github.com/Kudadjie/sandbox_projects2.0/blob/master/bash_scripts/interactive_no_return_nav_menu.sh):
      This program provides a very 'very' limited skeleton GUI, which can be used to navigate certain places on a linux device. The program should be sourced (user@computer $ source ./interactive_no_return_nav_menu.sh). Program is open to modifications to increase functionability.
      NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
      
3.  👨‍💻 [Disk / Memory Status](https://github.com/Kudadjie/sandbox_projects2.0/blob/master/bash_scripts/dm-stats.sh):
         This program provides a simple GUI to show the current memory and disk space status of your primary drive. Units are in Mi(MB), Gi(GB) and % .
      NB: Ideally, a symbolic link with a shorter name of liking of your choice should be made to it and the script should be added to the PATH environment variable for easy access.
